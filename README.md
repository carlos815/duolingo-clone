"Duolingo clone" is a bit of a stretch :)

This is a duolingo-like phrase completion interaction, with my own take on design. You just put the words in the right order to complete the phrase.

Technologies used:
-React + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
-[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styles.
-[Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for state management.
-[React Testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
